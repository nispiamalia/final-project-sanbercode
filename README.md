# Automation Test using Cypress - Final Project

Hello everyone! This repository contains the final project from the Quality Assurance bootcamp I attended at Sanbercode. For this final project, I've developed automation tests for the [Kasir Demo](http://kasirdemo.belajarqa.com/) website using the Page Object Model with Cypress.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of the Page Object Model (POM) for better test organization and maintenance.
- Automated tests cover various scenarios to ensure the robustness of the [Kasir Demo](http://kasirdemo.belajarqa.com/) application.
- Utilizes Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing framework.

**Functionalities Covered:**
The following functionalities were covered in this project (with various scenarios):
1. User login
2. Add categories
3. Add products
4. Add users
5. Add customers
6. Add purchasing products

**Testing Activities:**
1. Designed and Documented Test Cases: Created test cases for different functionalities and scenarios.
2. Executed Test Cases: Executed test cases to verify the functionalities.
3. Identified and Report the Issues: Discovered issues and reported them.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nispiamalia/final-project-sanbercode.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd final-project-sanbercode
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies.
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the Cypress tests.
   ```
   npx cypress open
   ```
   This will open the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to execute and observe the tests.

This is the result when I run the code:

Feel free to explore the code, run the tests, and adapt the automation scripts to fit your specific testing needs on [Kasir Demo](http://kasirdemo.belajarqa.com/). If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy testing!
