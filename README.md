# Automation Test using Cypress - Final Project

Hello everyone! This repository contains the final project I completed during the Quality Assurance bootcamp at Sanbercode. In this project, I've dedicated my efforts to creating automation tests for the [Kasir Demo](http://kasirdemo.belajarqa.com/) website using the Page Object Model with Cypress.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of the Page Object Model (POM) for better test organization and maintenance.
- Automated tests cover various scenarios to ensure the robustness of the [Kasir Demo](http://kasirdemo.belajarqa.com/) application.
- Utilizes Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing framework.

**Functionalities Covered:**
The following functionalities were covered in this project (with various scenarios)
1. User login
2. Add categories
3. Add products
4. Add users
5. Add customers
6. Add purchasing products

**Testing Activities:**
1. Designing and Documenting Test Cases:
Crafting detailed test cases, encompassing a wide array of functionalities and scenarios. This step ensures a thorough examination of the system's capabilities.

2. Executing Test Cases:
Engaging in the execution of test cases, the focus is on verifying the seamless functionality of the application. By systematically running these cases, I validate the expected outcomes across various use cases.

3. Identifying and Reporting Issues:
Discover and promptly report any identified issues. This proactive approach ensures a streamlined resolution process, contributing to the overall enhancement of the application's performance and reliability.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nispiamalia/final-project-sanbercode.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd final-project-sanbercode
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies.
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the Cypress tests.
   ```
   npx cypress open
   ```
   This will open the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to execute and observe the tests.

This is the result when I run the code:

Feel free to explore the code, run the tests, and adapt the automation scripts to fit your specific testing needs on [Kasir Demo](http://kasirdemo.belajarqa.com/). If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy testing!
